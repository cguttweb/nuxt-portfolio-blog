## Blog Post Ideas

- Gridsome - setup and thoughts on it so far...
  - vue meta-gridsome - need to look at this
- Vue - anything new I learn
- Tailwind CSS (adding to Gridsome/webpack/projects)
- dev.to community
- vscode and its plugins e.g prettier/eslint
- people who have non-tech degrees getting into tech/programming
- JAMstack once I've learnt about it
- webpack?
- PostCSS?
- General web dev thoughts
- HTML emails
- font awesome/icon fonts
- accesibility as I increase my understanding e.g. aria-label
- React/Gatsby when I start to learn although playing around with gatsby very similar to gridsome but the styling is in the JS which I'm not sure I like.
- Attribute selectors, psuedo classes and elements e.g. nth-child, :root, :not, ::first-letter
- Anything else when inspiration strikes
- GatsbyJS + netlifyCMS/forestry CMS
- CSS selectors which could be used as a reference
- ES6+ ?
