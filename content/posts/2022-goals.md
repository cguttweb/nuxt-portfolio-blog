description: Review of 2021 goals and setting some for 2022
---
My goals for 2021 were the following:

1. Work my way through the [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum particularly the JS section.
2. Work on Mastering Nuxt course - videos are being regularly released and need to keep up with these.
3. Write more CSS in most of my projects I tend to reach for [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and learn some more sass (I know some basics).
4. Get back into regular blogging I stopped towards the end of the year and need to start posting regularly again even if I don't finish them write a starting post which I can then review and add to as I feel necessary.

Having reviewed these goals:

1. I have done some of the FCC curriculum including finishing RWD section, working on some of the JS section and starting the front end libraries section - goal partially completed
2. This I haven't achieved I got about halfway through so I am going to back to the start and make my way through this course in the next couple of months
3. ~~This I have achieved working my way through some challenges on frontend mentor and some other small projects I have written plain ol' CSS including some SCSS avoiding the likes of bootstrap and tailwind~~ - goal complete!
4. Again I was in a routine with this for a while had a few ideas wrote some posts but then I stopped so a goal for this year will be to write at least a blog post every month about something I have learnt or refreshed on - ongoing

Goals to complete this year:
- Finish udemy course of vanilla JS projects - I started this today I've setup a github repo and have completed first project
- Complete Mastering Nuxt course and write a blog post reviewing it and what I have learnt
- Review some jQuery perhaps rewrite a couple of small vanilla JS projects
