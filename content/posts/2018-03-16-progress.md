So in my last post I mentioned an ES6 course I had started on udemy I have yet to finish it but am slowly making my way through it. I have spent more time on [treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) I have learnt a bit about front end performance optimisation, HTML video and audio (I now know video captions are created using SRT or VTT files) and the basics of Scalable Vector Graphics or SVG.

Not sure I'll be using audio and video a lot or SVG for that matter I'm a developer not a designer but good to understand how they work and why they are used.

Up is AJAX basics course which I'm aiming to complete in the next week I'm trying and being sort of successful at little and often when it comes to learning and coding. Not necessarily every day but enough to feel I am at least making some sort of progress.
