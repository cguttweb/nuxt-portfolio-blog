whenThere are many many array methods with more being added all the time as a new version of ECMAScript is released. There are a few methods which do the same thing and can reduce the need to use for loops in many cases it is knowing when to use each of them.

```javascript
let colours = ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'purple', 'orange']

// Using for loop

for(var i = 0; i < colours.length; i++){
  console.log(colours[i])
}

```

- forEach
- map - 
- filter -
