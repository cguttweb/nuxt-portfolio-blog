The Spread Operator which uses the `...` syntax was introduced in ES6 as a way of easily extracting all the elements from an array and it can be used where you would write comma separated values e.g. arrays or passing values to a function.

It is useful more succinct way of joining/concatenating arrays

Since ES2018 the spread operator can now also be used with objects.
