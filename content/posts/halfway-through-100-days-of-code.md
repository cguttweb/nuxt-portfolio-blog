Today Sunday 14th March 2021 marks the halfway point for me in the 100 days of code challenge I'm bit surprised I managed to get this far but I've gotten into a routine of doing a little bit everyday sometimes only 15-30mins but it all counts towards the challenge as I've been doing something every day.
