description: FCC front end libraries section
---
I've started relooking at the FCC curriculum in particular the front end libraries section - this includes bootstrap, jquery, sass basics, react and redux for state management in react.

- Bootstrap - as I have used bootstrap this was more of a refresher - section completed
- SASS - this was introducing some basics of sass including `mixins`, `@for`, `@each` and `@while`
- React - I've learnt some basics of React in the past year - I'm working my way through the React section but not how much I've learnt I think I just need to build a project with it to fully understand it
- Redux - I've heard of it but yet to learn anything about it
