[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is as described on their website:
>"a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes... that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup

It can be setup using tailwind CLI, postcss or there are a series of guides for a number of different frameworks on the website ranging from the likes of vite, vue to laravel and svelte.

Like many others I was initially hesistant about CSS frameworks as a result of the messy looking markup adding all those classes to your HTML creates. My first experience was using bootstrap as is likely the case for most developers and although I could see why it would be useful pre-defined components and a series of presets so you don't have to create your pwn framework.
