I think the next thing I need to try and get to grips with is the twitter [Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) framework. I've read a bit about it and know it is used in a lot of sites.

So I'm going to try and build out a few basic pages with it to try and understand how it all works. What I really want to get to grips with is the grid layout first of all and perhaps some of image and validation styles. I won't use a lot of it as the whole point is to use as a starting point a base to start from before adding my own content and styling.
