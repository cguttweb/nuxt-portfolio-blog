description: 'My first post on Dev.to community'
---

It's been a week since my last blog post and today Sunday 13th October I finally added my first post on [dev.to](https://dev.to/) community which I have been a member of and lurked around on for a few months now. Having a read of some of the posts inspired me to get out there and give it a go. My post was my thoughts around learning JavaScript and in particular Vue which I really like and am keen to learn more about its ecosystem.

It's definitely something I'd to do more of to contribute to the communiy and hoping learn a few things at the same time.
