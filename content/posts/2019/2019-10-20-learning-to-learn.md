title: 'Learning Plan'

Recently I've spent some time on [dev.to](https://dev.to) community reading posts about how people learn such the ways they gone about learning new frameworks etc and some of the resources they have used and it has given the idea of attempting to put together a learning plan of a few things I want to learn and things I need to refresh on e.g. DOM traversal and ES6 syntax. Intially I'm thinking about an hour at weekends maybe half hour every other day during the week. I'm going to try and do this for a couple of weeks and see how I get on. First things first I need to write a list of both I *want* to learn and what I *need* to learn to help with my job and in either case further my personal knowledge and development. 

I'm going to start taking notes again as I feel I retain certain information better when writing it down rather than typing as well as practicing more alongside I think I am going to start with some basic JS around variables and functions with some flexbox. 

I'm going to try and post a bit more on dev.to and instagram to keep a record of what I'm going to be using codepen for simple snippets.
