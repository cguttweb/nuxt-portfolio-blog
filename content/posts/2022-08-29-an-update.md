description: what I've been up to
---
What have I been up to for the past couple of months in all honestly not a lot. I have made a start at learning vue 3 in particular the composition API through vueschool but have learnt that the options API available with vue 2 is still compatible with vue 3.

I've also looked into nuxt 3 basics through a intro course on [vue mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com) as it is now in RC and could will be released as a stable version soon enough when this happens I will look at rebuilding my portfolio site with it...because why not? I have been planning and researching a couple of site ideas I have hopefully they will develop and evolve.

I have started a course on nodejs and have been distracted by vue and nuxt 3 but go back and look through into this and I need to build a couple of small projects to add into my personal site which is looking a bit sparse as it hasn't been updated in a while. I need to get back into learning regularly again and writing blog posts on it as I've gotten out of the habit again - must do better!!
