description: Review of 2020 goals and set some of 2021
---
These are the goals I set for 2020:
- go through wes bos CSS grid course again one weekend I've learnt the basics of css grid but don't feel as confident with it as I do with flexbox yet
- finish modern JavaScript udemy course
- finish all the challenges on the frontend mentors site 
- finish my vue udemy course and go through all the assignments
- have a fully working of my coffee-matcher app
- style my blog/portfolio with tailwind css and add some projects to it
- attempt to learn more about accessibility

1. CSS grid course - I didn't go through the CSS Grid course again however I have used a bit more and know a bit more about it so partially achieved.
2. finish the course I did most of this with the exception of one of the projects so I did not achieve this one
3. Finish all the free challenges - probably a bit ambitious this one but I did complete quite a few and have started another - so partially achieved
4. This was also probably too ambitious I did get more than halfway through this (I probably could have finished it but it was a struggle at times) it has since been updated to Vue 3 so I go through this at some point.
5. I have partially working version with some basic logic setup - goal partially achieved
6. I moved from Gridsome to another Vue-based framework Nuxt and set up my blog, written some posts and add projects to the site - goal achieved!
7. I did start to learn a bit about accessibility starting with colour contrast font-sizes using the axe and wave plugin browsers to give more information
