title: 'linux switch'
date: 2017-11-11

I've spent most of this afternoon trying and (finally) succeeding in removing Windows 10 from my laptop and replacing it with [Linux Mint](http://www.linuxmint.com) which is based on [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com). I have used ubuntu previously in an old laptop before it died and did enjoy using it. I have a dual boot system on my desktop having managed to install linux alongside Windows 10 without issue as I built itself so there was no pre-installed stuff to cause issues.

With my laptop having a UEFI BIOS installed as with most new computers it caused a bunch of issues but after much googling and trying a variety of boot options I found a solution on the linux forums but changing the boot options on GRUB menu and *finally* Linux boots ok and no more Windows....

I'm going to use Linux exclusively for any development and coding stuff I'm doing at home I much prefer the environment and I can use all the usual tools. And as I discovered the other day PHP is a pain in the ass to install on Windows (as is Jekyll when I first attempted to setup my blog) go figure...

Hopefully my post will involve me actually learning about something code related.
