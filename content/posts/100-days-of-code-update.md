description: update on how the challenge is going so far
---
Today was day 29 I'm surprised I've managed to get this far into it without missing a day admittedly some days have been better than others. I'm keeping up with my daily posts on Instagram to document some of what I have been looking/working on as well as blog posts and some physical notes on paper which I feel do help me retain some information better.

The hardest thing I've found in terms of learning so far has definitely been recursion I partially understand the theory, but the why and how of using iu goes over my head. One day the penny will drop, but so far struggling to fully grasp it. Otherwise it's been pretty good most days I've been working my way through the [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum some of which has been refreshing some things such as flexbox and learning some new things e.g. `Object.keys()` and `Object.freeze()`.
