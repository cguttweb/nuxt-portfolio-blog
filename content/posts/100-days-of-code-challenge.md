description: My thoughts on taking up the challenge
---
Yesterday I (re)started the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum and am finally going to attempt the 100 days of code challenge. I've debated doing it more than once and resisted doing it thinking I would struggle to do it but new year new start so figured it's about time. I've struggled to get into any sort of routine in recent months with trying to learn new things or even practice enough I've done it for a few days and then stopeed again this year I'm more determined to try and not do that.
