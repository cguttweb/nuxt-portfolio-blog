excerpt: My thoughts on 2020 Learning Goals
---

As with many developers I've struggled at times to keep up with the rapid changes in the web development world particularly around JavaScript and the seemingly endless numbers of frameworks from [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to [Angular](https://angularJavaScript.org/) and many others in between.

I've learnt some Vue and I would like to learn React at some point, but as a self-taught developer through using [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), Treehouse and [udemy](https://www.udemy.com) courses among other resources there are gaps in my knowledge that perhaps I would have learnt had I done a Computer Science degree or a bootcamp I feel around things like how browsers and DNS actually work, web security e.g. CORS and conventions and accessibility. Some of this can naturally be picked up as you gain more experience if you've seen things before you know how to approach it and how your code should be structured.

I've attempted to collate my resources and put together a general learning plan partially inspired by this [frontend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) and looking through several posts on [dev.to](https://dev.to) to see what others have done and create something similar for myself.

I'm going to split it into sections - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JavaScript Frameworks, Security and other e.g. DNS and how it works. Doing this is an attempt to break it down and I will no doubt break it down further particularly when it comes to JavaScript.

I'm going to stick with one or two resources rather than the myriad I've attempted to starting with finishing a JavaScript course and a Vue course on udemy with MDN as my go-to for any terms I don't understand.

I have a few goals for this year (I partially achieved my ones for last year hopefully to do better this time round..) these are currently (as ever they may change):

- go through wes bos css grid course again one weekend I've learnt the basics of css grid but don't feel as confident with it as I do with flexbox yet
- finish modern JavaScript udemy course (I'm halfway through looking to complete before the end of February)
- finish all the challenges on the frontend mentors site (I've completed a couple and am working on others)
- finish my vue udemy course and go through all the assignments
- have a fully working of my coffee-matcher app (still to figure out the logic)
- style my blog/portfolio with tailwind css (which I have started) and actually add some projects to it...
- attempt to learn more about accessibility

There are a few goals/challenges most of which I feel are achievable but I need to be a bit structured in both my learning and my own projects and focus on one thing at a time rather than trying to do many things at once. Admittedly I have said that before and failed but this time I feel more determined to stick it as I feel I need to if I'm going to be able to progress to the next level (although I'm not entirely sure what that looks like right now).

This is my first proper post of 2020 later and longer than I planned. I'm looking at get back into a weekly/fortnightly post with something new I have learnt so until next time.
