So I haven't posted for a while again... I may get into a routine at some point (read probably not).

With regards to progress I have dabbled a bit with Bootstrap and started ES6 JavaScript course I found on [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) currently working through the Array helpers section. It will then include some work on const and let definitions, arrow functions and template literals which I've learnt a bit about. Before some more advanced options such as Classes and Promises.

Hopefully will post another update when the course is finished hopefully within a week or two.
