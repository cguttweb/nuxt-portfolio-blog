description: Further update on progress
---
It's been a couple of weeks since my last post so figured it was time to post an update on how I am getting on and what I have covered so far.

T﻿he Web Development path I am currently **36%** of the way through the overall pathway.

5. JavaScript: Arrays, Loops, and Objects - 75% complete I have a series of challenges to through to finish this section
6. Building Interactive JavaScript Websites
7. Intermediate JavaScript
8. Learn the Command Line- I am currently working my way through this section I know some basics but keen to improve this
9. Learn Git & GitHub - started WIP

Full Stack path covers the following much of which links in with the web development path listed above. Overall I am **23%** through this path.

- Web Development Foundations - this section is almost complete I have a couple of small projects to finalise
- Building Interactive Websites - partially complete WIP

I﻿'ve made reasonable progress on this, but I have realised I really need to practice with JS some more as I half remembered some parts of syntax/methods etc I need to think of some small projects I can use to reinforce these things I am learning.
