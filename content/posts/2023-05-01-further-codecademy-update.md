description: An update on progress so far
---
It's been a couple of weeks since my last post so figured it was time to post an update on how I am getting on and what I have covered so far.


5. JavaScript: Arrays, Loops, and Objects - 75% complete
6. Building Interactive JavaScript Websites
7. Intermediate JavaScript
8. Learn the Command Line
9. Learn Git & GitHub - started WIP
10. Building Front-end Applications with React
11. JavaScript Back-End Development
12. SQL and Databases for Web Development
13. Building a Persistent API
14. Test-Driven Development with JavaScript

Full Stack path covers the following much of which links in with the web development path listed above.

- Web Development Foundations - this section is almost complete I have a coupleof small projects to finalise
- Building Interactive Websites - partially complete WIP
- Front-End Development
- Back-End Development
- Full-Stack Development
- Interview Prep

I'm aiming to post an update once a week on how progress I have (or haven't) made working through these paths, but so far so good I think I need to think of some ideas to reinforce the JS I've learnt so far especially around objects.
