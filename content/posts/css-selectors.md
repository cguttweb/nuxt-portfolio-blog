## IDs

IDs must be unique on a page and are targeted using a `#` (hash) e.g.

```css
#my-page {
  background-color: yellow;
  color: red;
}
```

## Classes

To target classes which are reusable use `.` (dot) notation

```css
.main-nav {
  display: flex;
}
```

## Sibling and adjacent selectors

```css
```
