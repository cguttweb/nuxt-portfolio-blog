CSS Grid was introduced to the spec in 2018? and is designed to help make layouts easier. 

To create a grid container use `display: grid` inside this are grid items

To set rows and columns use `grid-template-rows|columns`

fr = fraction unit will be listened to after any fixed values e.g. 50px

`repeat(number of columns/rows, value)` e.g. repeat(4, 1fr)
`minmax()` this is used to set min and max width for columns or rows

`autofill|autofit` can be used instead of explicitly defining a number of tracks

`Explicit grid` - user-defined

`Implicit grid` - automatically generated by grid container

grid-auto-rows/colums...
grid-auto-flow...

grid lines can use negative values 

cols = right to left starting at -1
rows = bottom to top starting at -1

this is useful if you don't know the number of rows/cols and want to stretch elements full width or fix element e.g. footer at bottom of the page
