I've started learning about PWAs or Progressive Web Apps with a udemy course by Academind and am going to attempt to build one by restarting my quiz app idea as a PWA rather than the initial desktop-based electron app idea. 

I'm going to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as my development tool rather than webpack check, out the documentation to learn more.
