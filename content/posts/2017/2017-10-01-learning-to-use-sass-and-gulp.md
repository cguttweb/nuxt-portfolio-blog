title: 'having a go using gulp and sass'

I've had a go at learning the basics of both sass and gulp before. Having watched a few videos and read a number of tutorials I decided to have another go.

I've setup a test folder locally to have a go with that and using browsersync to automatically reload the browser when changes are made to files. It partially works, but I understand the basics of how it works and think I'll have a go at using it with a new project and see how I go.
