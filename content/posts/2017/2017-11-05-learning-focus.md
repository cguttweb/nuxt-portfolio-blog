So much for weekly posts but sometimes I've forgotten other times I've not done much. More recently I've been going over some of the basics of JavaScript and jQuery - selecting and modifying elements and some basic jquery effects. I definitely want to become better with JavaScript and will take a look at the JavaScript track on [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com)

I have created a couple of basic pages with Bootstrap (4 as it is now in beta) to understand the way it works although I wouldn't necessarily use it all the time I am going to use in a mini-project I have in progress.
