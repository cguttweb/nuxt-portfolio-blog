So I started work on creating a few pages based on the [Bootstrap framework](http://www.getbootstrap.com). I have come up a few ideas to try and get to grips with the grid system, using many of the default styles present to start with and also learning how to override these with my own styles. It will be useful to understand how it works, although I don't plan to using it often in personal projects it is worth developing some knowledge as it may be possible to then carry that forward if I ever use other frameworks such as Zurb's [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/).
