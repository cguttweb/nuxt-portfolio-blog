Next up some basic JavaScript for redirecting on a button click. Firstly doing so in the same window and seocndly by opening new tab or window (dependant on the browser). So in the same window would be by using window.location ```window.location.href = 'your url here';``` or to do so in a new window you can use ```window.open("your url here", "_blank")```

I've also learnt some basic ES6 Syntax so for example arrow functions so instead of ```('click', function(parameter){ // your code here});``` this would then become ```('click', () => { // your code here })```
