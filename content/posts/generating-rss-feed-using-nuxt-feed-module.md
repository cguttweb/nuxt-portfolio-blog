Moving from Gridsome to Nust for most of this was fairly straightforward as from one vue framework to another the majority of the content stayed the same. I had to setup pulling posts differently using `asyncData` but reading the docs I found that more straightforward than trying to use GraphQL as I did with Gridsome.
