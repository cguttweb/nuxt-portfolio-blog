description: A lightweight markup language

Markdown was created in 2004 by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz as a lightweight markup language with the goal of enabling people to write using an easy-to-write and read plain text format with the option to convert it to structurally valid XHTML/HTML. There have several implementations since it was initially created with the need for additional features e.g. tables and footnotes.

# Basic Syntax

## Headings

Headings are indicated by `#` these range from `#` (h1) to `######` (h6)

## Text Formatting

bold text - wrap text in double asterisks **this text will be bold** or double underscores and __so will this__

italic text - wrap text in underscores `_text_` or single asterisk `*more text*` so _this is in italics_ and so *is this text*


I particularly like using it for my blog posts because it is easy to use and makes formatting text and code blocks sstraightforward. I use [prism](https://prismjs.com/) to provide syntax highlighting for my code blocks for inf on how to do this with nuxt chck out the [docs](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/directory-structure/content#syntax-highlighting)
