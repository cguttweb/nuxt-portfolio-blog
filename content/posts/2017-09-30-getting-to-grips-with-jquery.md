title: 'Getting to grips with jQuery'
date: 2017-09-30

I have been working my way through the [pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) jQuery path. I think I am beginning to get to grips with it. The syntax is much easier to understand than plain JavaScript sometimes can be.

I am beginning to understand the syntax and how it works and the advantages and ease of using it over traditional JavaScript. The [documentation](http://api.jquery.com) is very good and clear to understand giving examples of various methods in action as well as those deprecated with each of the versions.

It does feel as though I am making progress and getting there, but more practice is required to fully come to terms with the power of jQuery.
