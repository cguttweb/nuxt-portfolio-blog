Media queries are used to modify your site or app depending on a devices types or specific characteristics e.g. width or screen resolution. They include the media type and the feature to be checked against.

Possible media types are:

- all - this is implied when using just `@media` without a specific type
- screen - for all screens e.g. pc or phone/tablet
- print - docs viewed on screen in print preview mode and paged material
- speech - for speech synthesizers
