Recently I have attempted to get started with React although its very different to Vue I thought knowing some ES6 and a bot about JSX having dabbled with Gatsby I had enough knowledge of some fundamentals to start learning React. 

I thought I'd have a go at re-creating one of my Vue apps using React as I built it with vue-cli I figured I'd use the React equivalent to scaffold the app:

`npx create-react-app My-React-App`
