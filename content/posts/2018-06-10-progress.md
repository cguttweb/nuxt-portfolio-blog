Following my previous post a couple of weeks ago... after failing to post for a while trying to get into the habit of posting regularly again. I am also keeping an written journal to jot my thoughts a few times a week.

After a less than productive day yesterday I spent most of it gaming after being roped into dog sitting for a few hours so I'm attempting to make up for it today. So far I finished the Callback functions in JavaScript course and the Landscape of JavaScript on Treehouse.

I have done a bit more on Sass basics course this week too learning a bit about mixins, how they work and how to use them in your files. Up next is using ```@extend``` functionality followed by the use of partial files which I have/do use and Sass functions.

I'm looking forward to it and intend to try and use some of what I learn in a couple of projects maybe my Portfolio and architecture sites which are (as always it seems) works in progress. I am probably going to end up starting again with my architecture as my ideas for it have changed since I originally built a starter page probably about 18 months ago. I'm going to do some research and have a think about layout how to structure the site and then perhaps restructure my dev setup to reflect this.

Until next time...
