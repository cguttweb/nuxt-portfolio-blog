description: 'Some thoughts on project ideas'
---

Currently I have a number of possible project ideas on the go. Firstly one was to create this blog and keep it regularly updated with what I am currently learning. WE'll see how long that lasts...

Secondly I'd like to create a test/practice site to learn how to use bootstrap and is used in a lot and seems a good idea to have a understanding of what it is and how it works.

In the past month or so, I have also been learning about the basics of sass pre-processor I have only used the basics of variables so far. I have a folder setup with gulp and a few plugins such as babel and sass to convert my ES6 Syntax and sass to more browser friendly JavaScript and CSS.

I'm trying and failing currently to try and get into a routine of learning a little bit and often seems to be a good way to learn and however I will be able to do this once I have a clear idea of what I want to learn and where I see my skills developing in the future.
