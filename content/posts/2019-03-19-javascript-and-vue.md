Recently work has been slightly quieter giving me some time for some JavaScript learning although relearning is probably more accurate at this point. I've been given an internal project to work on which has helped me understand how to apply some of what I have been learning into a real life project as well as learning a few new things and more about structuring code and making it more readable.

I think I need to go back some vanilla JavaSceript stuff watch a few videos and build some vanilla JS stuff move away from Vue or Electron and practice a bit more as doing this project has made me realise I have forgotten some javascript stuff as ever if you don't use it enough you forget it.

More football with the Legends game this weekend and then maybe some coding on Sunday afternoon...
