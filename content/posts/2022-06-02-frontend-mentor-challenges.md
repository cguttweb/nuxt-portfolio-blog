description: A website providing coding challenges

I came across Frontend Mentors a couple of years ago possibly via twitter I can't remember when looking for potential coding challenge ideas. As I am not a designer I've found this site particularly useful as it provides a mobile and desktop design and a style guide detailing colours and typography.

The challenges vary from newbie for those just starting out with coding to advanced using APIs so far I have completed some challenges ranging from newbie to intermediate and I will attempt some of the more advanced challenges once I feel more confident in my javascript. I have managed to learn more about CSS grid and have used some SCSS in most of my projects.


I'm currently working on a couple of challenges including the space tourism multi page website which I intend to create two versions. One using the base HTML as initially provided and one using vue so I take advantagesof using single file components (SFCs) and breaking the site down into individual components and make things more granular and reusable. There is an assocaitedcourse on scrimba I will take a look at to see the approach that has been taken and compare to how I have approached it.
