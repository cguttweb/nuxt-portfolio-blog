I came across Frontend Mentors a couple of years ago possibly via twitter I can't remember when looking for potential coding challenge ideas. As I am not a designer I've found this site particularly useful as it provides a mobile and desktop design and a style guide detailing colours and typography.

The challenges vary from newbie for those just starting out with coding to advanced using APIs so far I have completed some challenges ranging from newbie to intermediate and I will attempt some of the more advanced challenges once I feel more confident in my javascript.
