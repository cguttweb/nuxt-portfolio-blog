So as usual its been a little while since my last post. Since my last update I have reactivated my [Treehouse](http://www.teamtreehouse.com), I am continuing with the beginner JavaScript track to see how much I have taken in and the updates since I last logged in.

I am currently refreshing the basics of ES6 syntax including using ```const variableName``` and let instead of var depending on whether you wish to update or reassign a variable and arrow function syntax for example ```const sayName = () => { //do something; }```.

I have also signed up to another Wes Bos course to learn NodeJS which I will take at some point next year as well as finishing the JS30 course. At the moment I am attempting to refresh my current JavaScript skills and learn some more as mentioned around ES6 syntax and more advanced JS.

I have also bought some ebooks from [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com) these are:
    * Accessibility for Everyone
    * Just Enough Research
    * New CSS Layout - to help me learn about CSS Grid
    * Responsive Design: Patterns and Principles

These are to help me learn more about accessibility, layout and more general knowledge around web development and coding.
