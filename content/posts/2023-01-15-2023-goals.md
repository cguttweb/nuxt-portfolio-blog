Mï»¿y 2022 goals were:

- Finish udemy course of vanilla JS projects - **I managed to get halfway through this**
- Complete Mastering Nuxt course and write a blog post reviewing it and what I have learnt - **following the stable release of Nuxt 3 towards the end of 2022 may go back and take another look as I got halfway through this first time round**
- Attempt to complete the 100 days of code challenge again - **definitely nowhere near completing this again**
- I'm going to learn some node and express - **I started looking at some node basics but nothing on express**
