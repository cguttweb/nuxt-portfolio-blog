Today is 3rd May early May Bank Holiday 2021 and it is the final day of my first 100 days of code challenge. Overall it's been a positive experience and has gotten me back into a regular learning routine again which I've struggled with for the last few months. 

If I were to do it again I would perhaps put together a better plan on what I want to learn/refresh with a few ideas of things to build, as this time round I did switch between a few different things with my js course, a nuxt course and various Vue courses on Vue Mastery including learning about [vuetify](https://www.vuetifyjs.com).
