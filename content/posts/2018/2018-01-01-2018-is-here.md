I am still very much a beginner in the web development world and have tried a few things without really learning enough. So this year my main aims are to firstly become better at JavaScript (including ES6) I need to practice and just code more and secondly to learn CSS grid and incorporate that into a project.

After failing previously to setup and blog regularly I attempted to do os for the second half of 2017 and have committed to continuing this with more regularity in 2018. I'm hoping having them written down it may improve the prospect of me actually keeping them.

And I have updated my footer to 2018 (before I forget)...
