I've spent the last few days playing with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) and its content module as well as [nuxtjs/color-mode module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/color-mode-module) allowing you to switch between light, dark and sepia option. I have followed the setup instructions in the official blog [here](https://nuxtjs.org/blog/going-dark-with-nuxtjs-color-mode) it is fairly straightforward to do the only minor issue I had was the styling but I think that is my settings as I'm attempting to use it with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

I also setup [netlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) as I am creating nearly all of my content using markdown so I have setup the config file for various collections e.g. different continents based on my folder structure for content and in pages.

It is very much a work in progress and will continue to be for a while as I get together content and decide a bit on styling I just wanted to get something up and working initially.
