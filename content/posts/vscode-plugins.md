Like many developers, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my text editor of choice I thought I would share some of my favourite and most useful plugins:

- [bracket pair colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) - as the name suggests shows matching brackets in colours
- [Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight) - highlights colours in your code
- [HTMLHint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkaufman.HTMLHint) - highlights any stray or missing tags I've found this super useful for work when building emails
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) - quickly enable a local server
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) - I write in markdown a lot this helps to keep everything consistent and points out common errors e.g. going from # (h1) to ### (h3)
- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) - this pairs well with linter enabling you to see as you are writing in vscode
- [JavaScript (ES6) code snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets)
- [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) - adds material design icons to vscode
- [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) - sync your settings between different devices
- [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) - vue tooling for vscode
- [Tailwind CSS Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) - I've used tailwindcss in a few projects and have this super useful
