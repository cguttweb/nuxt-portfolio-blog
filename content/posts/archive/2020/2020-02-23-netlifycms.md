I've recently discovered NetlifyCMS after hosting my [gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) blog (and what will eventually be my portfolio) on netlify. I used the gridsome docs to add to my existing site it was super easy. I used the gridsome docs to add to my existing site it was super easy create an admin folder to get into the CMS with config file to setup github details and an uploads folder for any images. I pushed all my changes netlify redeployed the site and voila literally done in 10 minutes so much easier than I thought it would be. Brilliant.

For Gridsome you create an admin folder to get into the CMS with `config.yml` file to setup github details and an uploads folder for any images. I pushed all my changes netlify redeployed the site and voila literally done in 10 minutes so much easier than I thought it would be. Brilliant.

However if you don't or want to add this to an existing site you can simply use a template as listed on their [docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/) you can choose Gatsby, Hugo, Middleman or Preact as your starter click the Deploy to Netlify button it will ask you to connect to either Github or Gitlab (depending on why you wish to host your repository) change the name and it will push changes to your Github/Gitlab account and deploy to the Netlify CDN and in a couple of minutes your site is up and running. It really is that easy to get started.

It supports a number of static generators from vue-based gridsome and nuxt to react-based gatsby to jekyll and many others.
