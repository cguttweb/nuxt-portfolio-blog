title: 'Array and data types'

This weekend while attempting to do some learning without really having a plan (which as it turns out funnily enough is a dumb idea) I messed around with Sass and webpack for a bit before heading back to [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org) to look up some vanilla JavaScript stuff as the amount I appear to have forgotten in the past few months is more than I thought and I need to go over some things again.

Firstly I looked up arrays so what is an array you ask according to MDN:

> An array is an ordered collection of data (either primitive or object depending upon the language). They are used to store multiple values in a single variable. This is compared to a variable that can store only one value.

I knew can hold many different types of data what I learnt was the difference between types of data.  
  
**Primitive** data is *not* an object and has no methods.

There are **7** primitive data types in JavaScript:

- String - anything in quotes (single or double)
- Boolean - true or false
- Number - integers or floating numbers e.g. 3.14
- Null - there is no value or it is empty
- Undefined - a value is not defined
- BigInt - which admittedly I'd never heard of until I looked it up :eyes:
- Symbol - a new value introduced in ES6/ES2015

In JavaScript arrays are zero indexed and have many methods associated with them. Some of which I will go into in a future post once I've refreshed on the more common ones.
