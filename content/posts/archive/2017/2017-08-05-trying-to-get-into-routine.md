My updates have not been as regular as I would have liked or wanted partly because I have not done as much as would have wanted to recently. Following a move and dealing with everything that comes with that I have paused my treehouse subscription for the time being. I have however signed up for a 3 month trial with [pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) just to give it a go and see what it is like as well as several udemy courses I have started (and as yet have not finished...).

I have also found a youtube playlist on Bootstrap 3 to help me get to grips with that too, as well as several ideas I have to build a few basic pages to start learning the Bootstrap framework.

Hopefully I will now start to update a little more often.
