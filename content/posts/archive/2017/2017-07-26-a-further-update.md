title: 'Further Update'

So it's been a month since I last posted so much for regularly updating... Once my internet is back up and running again (roll on Saturday) I am planning on getting into a regular routine of attempting to learn/refresh a little bit every week. Starting with JavaScript and a flexbox refresh as although I first learnt about it approximately a year ago I have used it very little in projects so far.

I did successfully managed to install Steam and Origin on desktop Linux partition but I need to look at extending this to be able to install games and then perhaps attempt to do the same on my laptop with a larger partition and putting an SSD in it to hopefully speed things up.
