title: 'Starting to learn jQuery'

I'm currently attempting to learn some jQuery firstly I read a bit on its history, the available versions and when they were released. The most recent is v.3.2.1 and also where to find the [documentation](http://api.jquery.com).

Recently I signed up for a 3 month trial with [pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com) and am currently working my way through the jQuery path. So far I have learnt the basics of how to include jQuery in a page either locally or most commonly through a CDN and how (if needed) to use ```$(document).ready(function(){ // do something; })```.

Also the basics of selecting elements which works in the same way as CSS e.g. ```$('element'), (',classname') or ('#idname')``` as well as additional options of using the likes of :odd or :even
