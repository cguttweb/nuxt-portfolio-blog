## Fundamentals

<!-- Look at W3C -->

**WCAG** = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
**WAI** = Web Accessibility Initiative
**A11y** - look at the [A11y project](https://www.a11yproject.com/)

Web should be accessible to everyone and not all disabilities are visible - making sites more accessible results in benefits to all users

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility) is a good starting point

<!-- NVDA Voiceover -->

Some use assistive technologies e.g. screen readers

Key things to look at:

- access for screen readers
- ability to tab through app (tabindex)
- colour contrast

4 principles of accessibility (known as POUR):

- **Perceivable** - users must be able to perceive the information presented
- **Operable** - User Interface forms, controls and navigation are operable (easy to use)
- **Understandable** - information and the User Interface must be understandable to all
- **Robust** - (future-proof) users must be able to access content as technology advances and improves

Typography - stick to 1 or 2 font pairings for consistency and to help with load times
