## Getting Started

As with Vue the easiest way to get started with building React apps is to use the CLI for React this is Create-React-App (CRA):

```javascript
npx create-react-app YOURAPPNAME
```

To learn more about getting started with CRA check out the [docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
