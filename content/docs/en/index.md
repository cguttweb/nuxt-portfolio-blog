The documentation is split into categories (you can use the links on the left to navigate) these are :

- **HTML** - the building blocks of the web
- **CSS** - the styling/presentation layer of web dev often the most fun
- **JavaScript** - interactivity layer
- **Vue** - a great JavaScript front-end framework
- **React** - biggest framework out there
- **Miscellaneous** - for anything else including regex
- **Glossary** - for any web or coding related terms

They were updated over time including links to blog posts and projects as I increase my knowledge.
