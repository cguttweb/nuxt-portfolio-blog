## Getting started

Vue as noted in the [documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is a progressive framework for building User Interfaces. I found the best place to started was with the documentation which is very good and I am still learning especially with Vue 3 due out soon.

## Vue CLI

The [vue cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) is a tool for rapid vue prototyping as it will setup a folder structure for you. It can be installed using the following command:

```javascript
npm install @vue/cli -g
```

## Gridsome

Firstly install the gridsome cli

```javascript
npm install @gridsome/cli -g
```

and then to create a project

```javascript
gridsome create my-gridsome-site
```

## VuePress

This is what these docs are built with as I wanted 1. something Vue based and 2. this was designed for documentation sites

```javascript
npm install -g vuepress or yarn global add vuepress
```

## Nuxt

Unlike Vue or Gridsome you don't need to install a CLI tool for Nuxt as long as you have node installed this will work:

```javascript
npx create-nuxt-app project-name
```
