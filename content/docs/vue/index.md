## Getting started

Vue as noted in the [documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is a progressive framework for building User Interfaces. I found the best place to started was with the documentation which is very good and I am still learning and with Vue 3 ~~due out soon~~ out now.

## Vue CLI

The [vue cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) is a tool for rapid vue prototyping as it will setup a folder structure for you. It can be installed using the following command:

```javascript
npm install @vue/cli -g
```

To create a new Vue app via the cli simple

```javascript
vue create' YOUR_APP_NAME'
```

It will then guide you through the process of which setupo you would like you have the option to use the default setup (eslint and babel) with Vue 2 or Vue 3 or you can manually select options you wish to install from adding the router, vuex, css preprocessors and whether to add your config into separate files or simply add it into the `package.json` file.
