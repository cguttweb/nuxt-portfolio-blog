## Vite

Vite is a new kid on the block built by Evan You the creator of Vue.js. It works with a variety of frameworks including Vue, React and Svelte and it is **_fast_**. I have built a small Vue app with it to experiment with it and,get a feel for it I would definitely recommend it and will be using it again.

## Webpack

I have used this a bit with a couple of small practice projects.
